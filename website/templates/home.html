<!-- Fundamentals of Python and Mathematics (2-4 weeks): Review or learn the basics of Python programming and fundamental mathematical concepts such as linear algebra and calculus, which are essential for understanding machine learning algorithms.
Machine Learning Basics (4-6 weeks): Familiarize yourself with fundamental machine learning concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, evaluation metrics, and model validation techniques.
Deep Learning (6-8 weeks): Dive into deep learning, which includes neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Gain an understanding of how to train and optimize deep learning models.
Machine Learning Engineering (8-12 weeks): Explore topics specific to machine learning engineering, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model deployment, and productionizing machine learning models. Learn about tools and frameworks used in the industry, such as scikit-learn, Docker, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, etc.), and version control systems like Git.
Projects and Practical Experience (Ongoing): Work on real-world projects and participate in Kaggle competitions or other similar platforms to gain hands-on experience and strengthen your skills. This phase can be ongoing as you continue to refine your knowledge and apply machine learning concepts to practical problems. -->
